# Homework

Please open the homework registration link: https://classroom.github.com/a/u36_R321

Requirements:
- You need a working (github.com)[github.com] account as you will be asked to 
login to github.com
- The first member of your group should create a team when he or she visits the
registration link. The other team members can select that team and join it
- After you select your team, you will be redirected to a page showing a link
to your homework github repository.
- The github repository will be empty initially. I will upload the assignments
when all the teams are formed, then you can find it under a "Homework_xxx.Rmd"
file in your repository.
- When your assignment is available, you should download it from the repository
and open it with R-Studio.
- Don't forget to write the student ids and the names of the group members
in the solutions file.
- When you are finished with the solution, please upload it back into that repository.
To do that, open the original assignment file (on the repository page), find the
pencil icon and click on it. This will put the file in edit mode. Copy the contents of 
your solution, and paste it into the github editor, replacing the original content.
Click on the green "Commit" button at the bottom of the page. Verify that your
solution is correctly uploaded by opening file in github one more time.
- Verify that your code works by clicking on the "Knit" button in R-Studio. It
should compile a web-page with your solution. If the web-page does not appear, 
this means that there are errors in your code that need to be fixed.
